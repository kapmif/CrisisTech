## Core Combat Capabilities

### 1. Chemical Warfare-grade Hazard Mitigation
Equipped with an advanced 8-gas detection array, the robot continuously monitors methane (CH₄), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), chlorine (Cl₂), ammonia (NH₃), oxygen (O₂), hydrogen (H₂), and carbon dioxide (CO₂). Its dual-phase suppression system delivers 83.5L/s of pH-neutralizing foam or water, capable of creating instant containment barriers around chemical leaks. The integrated thermal imaging system detects hydrocarbon signatures from -50°C to 350°C, enabling proactive vapor cloud management.

### 2. Explosion-Proof Engineering
Certified to Ex d ibⅡB+H₂T6 Gb standards, the robot features three critical safety layers:
- Triple-layer water curtain cooling system for electronic components
- Anti-static rubber tracks with grounding modules
- Spark-resistant aluminum alloy construction

### 3. Chemical Decontamination Protocol
The operational sequence includes four critical phases:
1. **Containment**: 360° foam curtain deployment isolates hazard zones
2. **Neutralization**: Adjustable-pH solution injection (5.0-9.0 range)
3. **Air Quality Control**: Onboard scrubber reduces VOC concentrations
4. **Residual Collection**: Compatible with vacuum systems for final cleanup
