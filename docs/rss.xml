### Why This Matters?  
Our system transforms radiation protection from reactive mitigation to **predictive containment**. When tested at Fukushima-derived simulation facilities:  
- Achieved **2,400 hrs** of continuous unmanned operation  
- Cut radioactive waste volume by **62%** through smart saturation algorithms  
- Enabled **83% faster** post-incident site recovery

## Core Combat Capabilities

### 1. Chemical Warfare-grade Hazard Mitigation
Equipped with an advanced 8-gas detection array, the robot continuously monitors methane (CH‚ÇÑ), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H‚ÇÇS), chlorine (Cl‚ÇÇ), ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ), oxygen (O‚ÇÇ), hydrogen (H‚ÇÇ), and carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ). Its dual-phase suppression system delivers 83.5L/s of pH-neutralizing foam or water, capable of creating instant containment barriers around chemical leaks. The integrated thermal imaging system detects hydrocarbon signatures from -50¬∞C to 350¬∞C, enabling proactive vapor cloud management.

### 2. Explosion-Proof Engineering
Certified to Ex d ib‚Ö°B+H‚ÇÇT6 Gb standards, the robot features three critical safety layers:
- Triple-layer water curtain cooling system for electronic components
- Anti-static rubber tracks with grounding modules
- Spark-resistant aluminum alloy construction

### 3. Chemical Decontamination Protocol
The operational sequence includes four critical phases:
1. **Containment**: 360¬∞ foam curtain deployment isolates hazard zones
2. **Neutralization**: Adjustable-pH solution injection (5.0-9.0 range)
3. **Air Quality Control**: Onboard scrubber reduces VOC concentrations
4. **Residual Collection**: Compatible with vacuum systems for final cleanup
